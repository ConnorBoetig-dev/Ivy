# AI Media Search Application - Project Overview

## 🎯 Vision & Purpose

### What We're Building
An intelligent media search platform that allows users to upload photos and videos, automatically extracts rich content using AI services, and enables natural language search like "my dog playing outside" or "that video of Nick talking funny."

### Core Value Proposition
- **Upload Once, Search Forever**: Users upload media and can find it using natural descriptions
- **AI-Powered Understanding**: Comprehensive content analysis using AWS AI services
- **Lightning Fast Search**: Vector similarity search with sub-2-second response times
- **Production Ready**: Built for scale, security, and cost efficiency

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### High-Level Flow
1. **Upload**: User uploads photo/video → S3 storage → Processing queue
2. **Processing**: AI analysis (Rekognition + Transcribe + Comprehend) → Text extraction
3. **Embedding**: Combined text → OpenAI embeddings → Vector database storage
4. **Search**: User query → OpenAI embedding → Vector similarity search → Results

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes, PostgreSQL with pgvector
- **Queue System**: BullMQ with Redis
- **AI Services**: AWS Rekognition, Transcribe, Comprehend, OpenAI Embeddings
- **Storage**: AWS S3 with Cloudflare CDN
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth
- **Payments**: Stripe subscriptions
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Nginx, Cloudflare

## 🔄 Processing Pipeline Detail

### Image Processing Flow
1. Upload to S3 → Generate thumbnail → Queue image analysis
2. Rekognition: Extract labels, faces, text, celebrities, content moderation
3. Comprehend: Analyze extracted text for entities, sentiment, key phrases
4. Combine all analysis → Generate OpenAI embedding
5. Store embedding in PostgreSQL with pgvector

### Video Processing Flow
1. Upload to S3 → Extract frames → Generate thumbnail → Queue processing
2. Rekognition: Analyze key frames for visual content
3. Transcribe: Extract audio → Generate transcript
4. Comprehend: Analyze transcript for entities, sentiment, themes
5. Combine visual + audio analysis → Generate comprehensive embedding
6. Store with temporal metadata for searchability
