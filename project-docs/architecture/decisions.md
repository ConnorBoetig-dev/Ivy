## ADR-001: Database Selection - PostgreSQL with pgvector

### Status
Accepted

### Context
We need a database that can:
- Store traditional relational data (users, media metadata)
- Perform efficient vector similarity searches on embeddings
- Scale with our expected workload
- Integrate well with our Node.js/TypeScript stack

### Decision
We chose PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension over alternatives like:
- Pinecone (dedicated vector database)
- Elasticsearch with vector search
- Redis with RediSearch

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Single database for all data (simpler operations)
- Mature ecosystem and tooling
- ACID compliance for financial data
- Open source (no vendor lock-in)
- Good performance for our scale (<100M vectors)

**Negative:**
- Requires self-management of indexes
- Not as optimized as dedicated vector databases
- Limited to PostgreSQL hosting options

**Mitigation:**
- Use IVFFlat indexes for performance
- Monitor query performance closely
- Plan migration path if scale demands it
